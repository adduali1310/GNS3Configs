Issue:No OSPF neighbourship formed between ISP router and R2.

Debug:
1.Run the following command on ISP and R2:
- sh ip ospf neig
2. If there is no ISP IP address(11.1.1.1) in list then no neighbourship is formed.
3.Run the following command to check details of the interface:
 - sh run int g0/0(R2)
 - sh run int g1/0(ISP)
If both IPs are in same subnets there is some other issue. If not you need to bring them in the same subnet.
4. You can also use the ResolvedIssue Config to correct the issue.
