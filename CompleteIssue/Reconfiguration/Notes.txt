This is a small ISP Reconfiguration issue wherein the ISP has changed their IP Address as shown:

old ISP address -

ip address: 10.131.61.246
net mask: 255.255.255.252
Default : 10.131.61.245

new ISP address -

ip address: 10.131.61.246
net mask: 255.255.240.0
Default : 10.131.48.1

The Pre and Post Config demonstrate these changes and can be seen via the command:

sh ip ro ---> On doing so you can see the change of default gateway in both the cases. You may also try pinging any IP to see it works.
