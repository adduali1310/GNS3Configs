Use configs in the Issue folder to recreate issue.Use configs in the Resolution folder to resolve the issue.
Issue-Pinging from any other Vlan(PC2 for example) to PC8 causes issues.

Debug:
1.Open SW3 and run the following commands:
 - do sh ip int br ---> Check if Vlan 10 is present
2. Do the same for ESW1. If Vlan 10 is present on both SW3 and ESW1, that is the issue.
3.We can resolve this by removing the inteface vlan 10 from SW3.To do this use the resolved issue folder config or enter the following command:
no int vlan10

Side Note:
1.Run this command on both switches:
- do sh int trunk ---> Vlan 10 should be in allowed list.
